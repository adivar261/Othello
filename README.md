# Othello
This Java Othello game uses OOP principles like inheritance and abstraction to build gameplay and a GUI with Swing. A 2D array represents the board, and displacement arrays handle piece flipping. Abstract classes manage game components, while data structures like ArrayList track moves efficiently.
